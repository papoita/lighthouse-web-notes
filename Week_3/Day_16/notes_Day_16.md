# Object Orientation
concept of sofware development 1960s
split functin and used modules to avoid repetition and make code modular

Js is not striclty OO in the way that java or ruby are

Typically this behaviour takes the form of "methods", which is just the name we give to functions when they're tied to an object. Some methods might modify the object, some methods might ask the object for information, etc.

OO bundles (groups) together related state and logic into an object that can be passed around as a single entity.

## Classes in js
perform object orientation
but js uses another pattern called prototypes
diff syntax
after ES6 usig classes for OOP 

### Classes and Instances

Classes are blueprints or templates used to create instances of objects

OOP goals : code organization, re-use, modularity

### creation of objects

The class syntax.
The purpose of the new keyword and the concept of constructor functions.
The difference between classes and instances.
How we are able to create new object instances with and without class.

programming in an object oriented way. We are using objects to group state and logic in order to keep the code more organized. Now everything associated to a task has been encapsulated inside the task object.

## OOP part 2 - inheritance
class


inheritance to remove code duplication
build new class with an existing class
