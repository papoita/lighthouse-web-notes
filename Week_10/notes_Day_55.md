OR

## relatively measured or dynamically rendered

We can size and position elements based on a percentage system relative the size, height, and width of the browser window. For example, 1vw is 1/100th of the size of the width of the viewport

## Em and Rem

The em and rem measurements offer an alternative to using px to size elements and type on the page. em units are sized relative to its parent element, whereas rem, or root em, are sized relative to the font size of the root element - usually, this is the <html> element.

## Flexbox

dynamically positions elements on a page without properties such as floats or columns. Flexbox is well supported by browsers, but not always consistent (so make sure to test in different browsers).
