For (let gameResult of gameResults){
Const isInObject = outcomeObj[gameResults.winner]
if(find in object){
winner= gameResults.winner
Loser = gameResult.looser
outcomeObj[winner] = [looser]}
Else {
outcomeObj[newwinnerKey].push(looser)
}

if(!gameResult.looser){
outcomeObj[gameResults.loser] = []}


outcomeObj = gameResults.winner //key
// value array of loser
}
