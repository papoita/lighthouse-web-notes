arrays can store everything from strings to arrays to functions

Arrays dont allow for scalability or order of information

maybe array of arrays would be usefull of accesing idexes but that is very cumbersome

we have to use bracket notation to access an object only when it has to be dynamic when sent by api

To add new value pairs to objects
to modify is the same
to delete
delete.team.year;

to keep the value pairs without deleting
teams["year"] = null;
to get aarrays within object you could search the index

when we modify the value of an object the variables will be modified pass by reference. mutate the actual data direclty
