# Promises

A promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The primary way of interaction with a promise is through its then method, which registers callbacks to receive either a promiseâ€™s eventual value or the reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.
A promise is an object
Promises do not rely on anything other than basic JavaScript
As of ES6, JavaScript has promises supported natively in its code. In other words, they are built into the language (via Promise)
