apps ARE DATA!

arrays and obj are data structures that organize data and allow more efficient management

Arrays are great when we have a list of data, especially when that list is in some order. Objects are great when we want to be able to look up data quickly using a key.

Each circle in the tree is called a node. A node represents a key entity and contains data about that entity. In this case, each node represents an employee and the data contains their name. All the connections between the nodes are called edges.
